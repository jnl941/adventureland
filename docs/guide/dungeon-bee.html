		Your character can get feared, there are 3 stages of fear
		<ul>
			<li>Scared</li>
			<li>Terrified</li>
			<li>Petrified</li>
		</ul>

		The following 3 character properties are relevant for your fear status
		<ul>
			<li>character.courage - max amount of physical targets before getting scared</li>
			<li>character.mcourage - max amount of magical targets before getting scared</li>
			<li>character.pcourage - max amount of pure targets before getting scared</li>
		</ul>

		Getting feared has the following debuffs where each stage is worse than the previous feared stage
		<ul>
			<li>movement speed reduction</li>
			<li>attack damage reduction</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- prettier-ignore -->
		<div class='code'>
if (character.fear > 2) {
	// Your character is petrified
} else if (character.fear > 1) {
	// Your character is terrified
} else if (character.fear) {
	// your character is scared
}

	player.fear = excess;

	<p><span class="warning">No More Stacking:</span> This is a very major change, 
		an extremely common practice for both PVE and PVP was to put all party characters in one spot, 
		for a bystander, it's very displeasing, you can't see who's who, 
		for PVP, it was extremely advantageous, you can't easily execute a strategy against 6 characters in one spot, without Code, 
		you can't even target them, so with this new system, each attack to stacked players increases the count by 1, 
		similar to terrified/petrified state, but, for the group, the total damage is calculated from the cumulative count, 
		so basically, on PVP, even a single Rogue can eliminate a stacked party with a Supershot+Shot.</p>
	<p>Both systems aren't perfect yet, the first one doesn't have to be, but the stack prevention system is very aggressive, 
		I'm planning to add both Code + Game Log warnings soon.</p> -->

<!-- 
Mechanics notes:
queen is slow, she spawns eggs, 
unfertalized eggs spawns drones (males)
A fertilized bee egg becomes a worker bee (female).

Before leaving, queen cells are left behind. 
Worker select several cells with fertilized eggs or female larvae.

These larvae are fed a special diet (including royal jelly) that allows them to develop into a reproductive queen. 
This development time is the shortest of any bee in the hive:16 days from egg to adult.

eggs should get a debuff applied that damages them, upon death a larvae is spawned
this larvae also get a dmg debuff applied, then a drone or worker is born.
drones mate with the queen, making sure she can spawn eggs





Notes:
Inside a beehive you will find: a queen, drones and workers. 
The number of each kind of bee in the hive will vary due to hive conditions and the time of year.

For instance, drone bees are males and will usually not be present in a healthy hive during Winter. 
However, during Spring and Summer it is common to have several hundred drones. 
They are needed for mating with new queens.

Queen – one per hive
Drones – few hundred during Spring/Summer
Workers – thousands
A honey bee colony has a remarkable system for communication and division of the tasks for its work force. 
Each member of the colony has a primary role and are physcially designed for their tasks.

Two types of bees in the hive (queens and drones) are primarily designed for bee reproduction. 
The colony could not continue without their involvement.

However, it is the female worker bees that perform the great variety of daily tasks needed. 

In addition to egg laying, the queen bee also gives off queen pheromones – often called “queen substance”. 
These external hormones (chemical messengers) are very important to the honey bee colony.

Queen could have an aura?

In a honey bee hive, there are three main types of bees, each with distinct roles:

Queen Bee: There is only one queen in a hive. 
Her primary role is to lay eggs, and she is essential for the colony's survival. 
The queen produces pheromones that help maintain colony cohesion and regulate the behavior of other bees.

Worker Bees: Worker bees are females that do not reproduce. 
They perform various tasks such as 
- foraging for nectar and pollen
- tending to the queen and developing brood
- cleaning and defending the hive
- and producing beeswax. 
Worker bees are the most numerous bees in a hive.

Drone Bees: Drones are male bees, and their primary purpose is to mate with a virgin queen during her nuptial flight. 
Unlike worker bees, drones do not have stingers and are not involved in foraging or other hive activities. 
Drones are relatively few in number compared to worker bees. -->
